# Tissue Datasets

Scripts for getting tissue and cell-type specific expression in gene expression datasets.

### GTEx_reads_summaries_pref.ipynb

Gets preferentially expressed genes in GTEx tissue defined as > 2 standard deviation than median.

### Nowakowski_preferential.ipynb

Gets preferentially expressed genes in cell-types defined as > 2 standard deviation than median.

### BrainSpan_which_dev_stage_preferential_finegrain.ipynb

Gets preferentially expressed genes in Brainspan tissue defined as > 2 standard deviation than median.
