Scripts for [16p12.2 RNA sequencing paper](https://autism.bx.psu.edu/).

# Description

Directories correspond with different sections of the text. The data directory has general datasets used in multiple sections.

* global_differential_expression: Differential expression between carriers and non-carriers of the deletion
* effect_size: Effect of rare variants towards gene expression changes
* family_based: Family-based differential expression and alternative splicing
* BSNA: Brain-specific network analysis
* ASE: Allele specific expression
* eQTL: expression quantitative trait loci
* WGCNA: Weighted gene correlation network analysis
* linear_model: Association between all gene expression change metrics

The following files in the data directory are dummy files. To get the original files see the [paper](https://autism.bx.psu.edu/).
* gene_reads.tsv
* phenotypes.tsv
* gene_level_expression.tsv
* all_gene_expression_differences.tsv
* ase_gene_ae.tsv
* global_de_genes.tsv
* brain_specific_network.tsv
