# 16p12.1 RNAseq project
Scripts for [16p12.2 RNA sequencing paper](https://autism.bx.psu.edu/). Directories correspond with different sections of the text. The data directory has general datasets used in multiple sections.


* alignment
* gene_and_isoform_counts
* quality_control
* gene_coverage
* global_differential_expression
* effect_size: Effect of rare variants towards gene expression changes
* family_based: Family-based differential expression and alternative splicing
* alternative_splicing: Family-based alternative splicing
* BSNA: Brain-specific network analysis
* ASE: Allele specific expression
* eQTL: expression quantitative trait loci
* WGCNA: Weighted gene correlation network analysis
* linear_model: Association between all gene expression change metrics
* datasets
